Modelling Diabetes data with Tensorflow and Pytorch 

The dataset has a labeled column and it's a classification dataset. 
Simple NN has been created in both Tensorflow and Pytorch 
SAme dataset has been used in both the files to see the similarity, difefrence in the code structure and also the to identify which can be easier for further use.
